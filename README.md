# Retopology
This is a project for creating a page that can do retopology of 3D models that have poor topology.

You can upload different 3D model types have them visualized in the original model container with their topology "highlighted" as in you can easily see the polys with a wireframe, and then by clicking the process model button have the model processed to produce a model with better topological structure.

The current model types it can handle are .stl,.obj,.fbx,.ply,.gltf,.dae,.glb, and .3ds models. Ply is a tiny bit tricky, you can see when you load the model that it has tiny odd flashes every once in a while, wasn't sure how to fix that.
