# Retopology
This is a project for creating a page that can do retopology of 3D models that have bad topology.

Although unfinished as the model that has retopology done to it doesn't appear in the container correctly yet, I still believe there are parts of this script that have value, and I'll be finishing this project in the near future.
You can upload different 3D model types have them visualized in the original model container with their topology "highlighted" as in you can easily see the polys, and then by clicking the process model button have the model processed to produce a model with better topological structure.
